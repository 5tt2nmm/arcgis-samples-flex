## Getting Started

1. Open Adobe Flash Builder, choose File -> Import Flash Builder Project.
2. Select Project folder, click Browse, and navigate to the downloaded "web" folder.
3. Add the API Library to the project through Project.
    * Go to Project -> Properties -> Flex Build Path -> Library Path -> Add SWC (and locate the "agslib-#.#-YYYY-MM-DD.swc").
    * Alternatively, copy the swc library to the libs folder under the "FlexAPI-Samples" project.
4. In Adobe Flash Builder, click "Run Application".  The "TiledMap" application should launch and display in your default web browser.
